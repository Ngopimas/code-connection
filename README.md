# Code Connection

A developer-themed platform game where you connect code blocks by building bridges between platforms. This is a re-themed version of the classic "Stick Hero" game concept.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Help your developer character traverse platforms by creating connections (code bridges) between them. Score points by making successful connections and try to achieve the highest score!

2. **Controls**:

   - **Click/Tap and hold**: To extend a connection (build code)
   - **Release**: To deploy the connection

3. **Scoring**:
   - Basic connection: 1 point
   - Perfect connection (hitting the target area): 2 points
   - Consecutive perfect connections: Increasing multiplier for bonus points

## Game Features

- **Developer Character**: A programmer with a laptop
- **Code-Themed Platforms**: Platforms styled as code blocks with syntax elements
- **Tech Environment**: Binary pattern background with circuit-like hills and server racks
- **Debug Mode**: Toggle debug mode to:
  - View distances and perfect hit spots
  - Get larger target areas
  - See helpful guidelines for perfect hits
  - Monitor game state in real-time

## Development Notes

This game is built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with no external dependencies. It uses a canvas element for the game rendering.

You can check every animation of the character in the [Character Showcase](https://ngopimas.github.io/code-connection/character-showcase.html).

## Potential Improvements

- Add sound effects (keyboard typing, deployment sounds)
- Add different levels with different themes
- Add powerups (coffee boost?)
